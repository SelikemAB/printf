# Printf
## This is the first team project for ALX. 
> The printf project is a collaboration between Evans Nyarko and Selikem Asare-Brown, actual students of Software Engineering at ALX, where the function labelled "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
